\title{LMMsolver: Linear Mixed Model Solver}
\description{
An efficient and flexible system to solve sparse mixed model
    equations, for models that are often used in statistical genetics. 
    Important applications are the use of splines to model spatial or temporal
    trends. Another application area is mixed model QTL analysis for 
    multiparental populations, allowing for heterogeneous residual variance and
    random design matrices with Identity-By-Descent (IBD) probabilities.

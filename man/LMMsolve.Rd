\arguments{
\item{fixed}{A formula for the fixed part of the model. Should be of the
form "response ~ pred"}

\item{random}{A formula for the random part of the model. Should be of the
form "~ pred".}

\item{spline}{A formula for the spline part of the model. Should be of the
form "~ spl1D()", ~ spl2D()" or "~spl3D()". Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) can
also be used, for example "~ spl1D() + spl2D()"}

\item{group}{A named list where each component is a numeric vector
specifying contiguous fields in data that are to be considered as a
single term.}

\item{ginverse}{A named list with each component a symmetric matrix, the
precision matrix of a corresponding random term in the model. The row and
column order of the precision matrices should match the order of the
levels of the corresponding factor in the data.}

\item{weights}{A character string identifying the column
of data to use as relative weights in the fit. Default value NULL, weights are
all equal to one.}

\item{data}{A data.frame containing the modeling data.}

\item{residual}{A formula for the residual part of the model. Should be of
the form "~ pred".}

\item{family}{An object of class family specifying the distribution
and link function.}

\item{offset}{An a priori known component to be included in the linear
predictor during fitting. \code{Offset} be a numeric vector, or a character
string identifying the column of data. Default \code{offset = 0}.}

\item{tolerance}{A numerical value. The convergence tolerance for the
modified Henderson algorithm to estimate the variance components.}

\item{trace}{Should the progress of the algorithm be printed? Default
\code{trace = FALSE}.}

\item{maxit}{A numerical value. The maximum number of iterations for the
algorithm. Default \code{maxit = 250}.}

\item{theta}{initial values for penalty or precision parameters. Default
\code{NULL}, all precision parameters set equal to 1.}

\item{grpTheta}{a vector to give components the same penalty. Default
\code{NULL}, all components have a separate penalty.}

Solve Linear Mixed Models using REML.

\details{
A Linear Mixed Model (LMM) has the form
\deqn{y = X \beta + Z u + e, u ~ N(0,G), e ~ N(0,R)} where
\eqn{y} is a vector of observations, \eqn{\beta} is a vector with the fixed
effects, \eqn{u} is a vector with the random effects, and \eqn{e} a vector of
random residuals. \eqn{X} and \eqn{Z} are design matrices.

LMMsolve can fit models where the matrices \eqn{G^{-1}} and \eqn{R^{-1}} are
a linear combination of precision matrices \eqn{Q_{G,i}} and \eqn{Q_{R,i}}:
\deqn{G^{-1} = \sum_{i} \psi_i Q_{G,i} \;, R^{-1} = \sum_{i} \phi_i Q_{R,i}}
where the precision parameters \eqn{\psi_i} and \eqn{\phi_i} are estimated
using REML. For most standard mixed models \eqn{1/{\psi_i}} are the variance
components and \eqn{1/{\phi_i}} the residual variances. We use a formulation
in terms of precision parameters to allow for non-standard mixed models using
tensor product splines.

\examples{
## Fit models on john.alpha data from agridat package.
data(john.alpha, package = "agridat")

## Fit simple model with only fixed effects.
LMM1 <- LMMsolve(fixed = yield ~ rep + gen,
                data = john.alpha)

## Fit the same model with genotype as random effect.
LMM1_rand <- LMMsolve(fixed = yield ~ rep,
                     random = ~gen,
                     data = john.alpha)

## Fit the model with a 1-dimensional spline at the plot level.
LMM1_spline <- LMMsolve(fixed = yield ~ rep + gen,
                       spline = ~spl1D(x = plot, nseg = 20),
                       data = john.alpha)

## Fit models on multipop data included in the package.
data(multipop)

## The residual variances for the two populations can be different.
## Allow for heterogeneous residual variances using the residual argument.
LMM2 <- LMMsolve(fixed = pheno ~ cross,
                residual = ~cross,
                data = multipop)

## QTL-probabilities are defined by the columns pA, pB, pC.
## They can be included in the random part of the model by specifying the
## group argument and using grp() in the random part.

# Define groups by specifying columns in data corresponding to groups in a list.
# Name used in grp() should match names specified in list.
lGrp <- list(QTL = 3:5)
LMM2_group <- LMMsolve(fixed = pheno ~ cross,
                      group = lGrp,
                      random = ~grp(QTL),
                      residual = ~cross,
                      data = multipop)

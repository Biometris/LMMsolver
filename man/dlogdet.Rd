\title{Calculate the partial derivatives of log-determinant.}
\usage{
dlogdet(ADobj, theta)
}
\arguments{
\item{ADobj}{object of class ADchol.}

\item{theta}{a vector with precision or penalty parameters}
}
\value{
The gradient with partial derivatives of \eqn{log|C|} with respect to
parameters \eqn{\theta_i}. As attribute \code{logdet}, \eqn{log|C|} is returned.
}
\description{
This function calculates the partial derivatives of the the log-determinant in an
efficient way, by using reverse Automated Differentiation of the Cholesky Algorithm,
see Smith (1995) for details. Let
 \deqn{C = \sum_{i} \theta_i P_i}
where the matrices \eqn{P_i} are stored in the `ADchol` object. The partial derivatives
of matrix \eqn{C} are defined by:
\deqn{\frac{\partial C}{\partial \theta_i} = \text{trace} [C^{-1} P_i]},
but are calculated in a more efficient way using backwards Automated Differentiation.

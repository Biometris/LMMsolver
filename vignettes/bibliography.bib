abstract = {Nearest-neighbour methods based on first differences are an approach to spatial analysis of field trials with a long history, going back to the early work by Papadakis first published in 1937. These methods are closely related to a geostatistical model that assumes spatial covariance to be a linear function of distance. Recently, P-splines have been proposed as a flexible alternative to spatial analysis of field trials. On the surface, P-splines may appear like a completely new type of method, but closer scrutiny reveals intimate ties with earlier proposals based on first differences and the linear variance model. This paper studies these relations in detail, first focussing on one-dimensional spatial models and then extending to the two-dimensional case. Two yield trial datasets serve to illustrate the methods and their equivalence relations. Parsimonious linear variance and random walk models are suggested as a good point of departure for exploring possible improvements of model fit via the flexible P-spline framework.},

@article{Rodriguez-Alvarez2015,
abstract = {A new computational algorithm for estimating the smoothing parameters of a multidimensional penalized spline generalized linear model with anisotropic penalty is presented. This new proposal is based on the mixed model representation of a multidimensional P-spline, in which the smoothing parameter for each covariate is expressed in terms of variance components. On the basis of penalized quasi-likelihood methods, closed-form expressions for the estimates of the variance components are obtained. This formulation leads to an efficient implementation that considerably reduces the computational burden. The proposed algorithm can be seen as a generalization of the algorithm by Schall (1991)—for variance components estimation—to deal with non-standard structures of the covariance matrix of the random effects. The practical performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by means of simulations, and comparisons with alternative methods are made on the basis of the mean square error criterion and the computing time. Finally, we illustrate our proposal with the analysis of two real datasets: a two dimensional example of historical records of monthly precipitation data in USA and a three dimensional one of mortality data from respiratory disease according to the age at death, the year of death and the month of death.},

@article{Rodriguez-Alvarez2018,
abstract = {An important aim of the analysis of agricultural field experiments is to obtain good predictions for genotypic performance, by correcting for spatial effects. In practice these corrections turn out to be complicated, since there can be different types of spatial effects; those due to management interventions applied to the field plots and those due to various kinds of erratic spatial trends. This paper explores the use of two-dimensional smooth surfaces to model random spatial variation. We propose the use of anisotropic tensor product P-splines to explicitly model large-scale (global trend) and small-scale (local trend) spatial dependence. On top of this spatial field, effects of genotypes, blocks, replicates, and/or other sources of spatial variation are described by a mixed model in a standard way. Each component in the model is shown to have an effective dimension. They are closely related to variance estimation, and helpful for characterising the importance of model components. An important result of this paper is the formal proof of the relation between several definitions of heritability and the effective dimension associated with the genetic component. The practical value of our approach is illustrated by simulations and analyses of large-scale plant breeding experiments. An R-package, SpATS, is provided.},

@article{Li2021,
abstract = {The identity-by-descent (IBD)-based mixed model approach introduced in this study can detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) referring to the parental origin and simultaneously account for multilevel relatedness of individuals within and across families. This unified approach is proved to be a powerful approach for all kinds of multiparental population (MPP) designs. Multiparental populations (MPPs) have become popular for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection. Tools for QTL mapping in MPPs are mostly developed for specific MPPs and do not generalize well to other MPPs. We present an IBD-based mixed model approach for QTL mapping in all kinds of MPP designs, e.g., diallel, Nested Association Mapping (NAM), and Multiparental Advanced Generation Intercross (MAGIC) designs. The first step is to compute identity-by-descent (IBD) probabilities using a general Hidden Markov model framework, called reconstructing ancestry blocks bit by bit (RABBIT). Next, functions of IBD information are used as design matrices, or genetic predictors, in a mixed model approach to estimate variance components for multiallelic genetic effects associated with parents. Family-specific residual genetic effects are added, and a polygenic effect is structured by kinship relations between individuals. Case studies of simulated diallel, NAM, and MAGIC designs proved that the advanced IBD-based multi-QTL mixed model approach incorporating both kinship relations and family-specific residual variances (IBD.MQMkin{\_}F) is robust across a variety of MPP designs and allele segregation patterns in comparison to a widely used benchmark association mapping method, and in most cases, outperformed or behaved at least as well as other tools developed for specific MPP designs in terms of mapping power and resolution. Successful analyses of real data cases confirmed the wide applicability of our IBD-based mixed model methodology.},

@article{Bustos-Korts2019,
abstract = {Genomic prediction of complex traits, say yield, benefits from including information on correlated component traits. Statistical criteria to decide which yield components to consider in the prediction model include the heritability of the component traits and their genetic correlation with yield. Not all component traits are easy to measure. Therefore, it may be attractive to include proxies to yield components, where these proxies are measured in (high-throughput) phenotyping platforms during the growing season. Using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM)-wheat cropping systems model, we simulated phenotypes for a wheat diversity panel segregating for a set of physiological parameters regulating phenology, biomass partitioning, and the ability to capture environmental resources. The distribution of the additive quantitative trait locus effects regulating the APSIM physiological parameters approximated the same distribution of quantitative trait locus effects on real phenotypic data for yield and heading date. We use the crop growth model APSIM-wheat to simulate phenotypes in three Australian environments with contrasting water deficit patterns. The APSIM output contained the dynamics of biomass and canopy cover, plus yield at the end of the growing season. Each water deficit pattern triggered different adaptive mechanisms and the impact of component traits differed between drought scenarios. We evaluated multiple phenotyping schedules by adding plot and measurement error to the dynamics of biomass and canopy cover. We used these trait dynamics to fit parametric models and P-splines to extract parameters with a larger heritability than the phenotypes at individual time points. We used those parameters in multi-trait prediction models for final yield. The combined use of crop growth models and multi-trait genomic prediction models provides a procedure to assess the efficiency of phenotyping strategies and compare methods to model trait dynamics. It also allows us to quantify the impact of yield components on yield prediction accuracy even in different environment types. In scenarios with mild or no water stress, yield prediction accuracy benefitted from including biomass and green canopy cover parameters. The advantage of the multi-trait model was smaller for the early-drought scenario, due to the reduced correlation between the secondary and the target trait. Therefore, multi-trait genomic prediction models for yield require scenario-specific correlated traits.},
